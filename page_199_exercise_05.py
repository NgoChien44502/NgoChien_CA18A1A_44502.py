Problem:
    Three versions of the summation function have been presented in this chapter.
One uses a loop, one uses recursion, and one uses the reduce function. Discuss the
costs and benefits of each version, in terms of programmer time and computational
resources required
Solution:
using our own loops is the best way of doing summation
