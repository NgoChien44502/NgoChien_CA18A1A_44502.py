Problem: Explain the importance of the interface of a class of objects.

Solution:
    Class inheritance is a means of sharing implementation (both state and behavior) between classes.
    Interface inheritance (subtyping) only specifies when one object can be used in place of another.
    The distinction is important because it is the type of an object that is important to flexible design.
