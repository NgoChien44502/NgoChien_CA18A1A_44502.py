Problem:
   Anne complains that defining functions to use in her programs is a lot of extra
work. She says she can finish her programs much more quickly if she just writes
them using the basic operators and control statements. State three reasons why her
view is shortsighted
Solution:
Code can be broken down into sub-parts using functions. which is easy to understand by any new joiner.
Function can be given a convenient name that describes its use in the program.
