Problem: Explain the advantages and disadvantages of lossless and lossy image filecompression schemes.

Solution:
 After sampling an image, it can be stored in any file format. The file that contains the sampled information is
    known as a raw image file.
Though the raw image file ensures a high amount of quality, the size of the file will be too large.
If a file is too large then it becomes more difficult to share it over a network.
In this situation, compression techniques such as lossless and lossy compression come into play.
These are the well-known compression techniques used to reduce the size of the file.
