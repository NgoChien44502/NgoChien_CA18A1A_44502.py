Problem: What is object instantiation? What are the options at the programmer’s disposal
during this process?

Solution:
    To instantiate is to create such an instance by, for example, defining one particular variation of object within
    a class, giving it a name, and locating it in some physical place. 1) In object-oriented programming,
    some writers say that you instantiate a class to create an object, a concrete instance of the class.
